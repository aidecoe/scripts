aidecoe's scripts
=================

This is common place for scripts I use here and there.

Don't trust these scripts too much.  These scripts automate some tasks for me,
they hardly ever have help usage and are not idiot-proof, but there's a chance
you can find a solution for your problem somewhere there.
